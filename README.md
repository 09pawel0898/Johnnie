## Description

Program was written as a part of engineering thesis for computer science degree. The goal of this thesis was to make a software tool rendering both static and animated 3D models using skeletal animation as an animation technique,
and modern OpenGL as an rendering backend. The result of the implementation work is a comprehensive software tool that meets the established requirements. The application allows user to load selected models and animations, 
supporting three model file formats. Rich graphical user interface offers several visualization modes, tools for manual loading object textures, editing lighting parameters, as well as manipulation of other parameters of the virtual world.
